## About this module

This module provides additional features for [Testerra Framework](https://github.com/telekom/testerra) for automated tests.

This module provides an automatic test result synchronization to MicroFocus Application Lifecycle Management, former called HP
QualityCenter. The module will register automatically by using `ModuleHook`.

See more details about the MicroFocus ALM REST API here: https://admhelp.microfocus.com/alm/en/12.55/api_refs/REST_TECH_PREVIEW/ALM_REST_API_TP.html

## Setup

### Requirements

| HPQC connector | Testerra         |
|----------------|------------------|
| `1.0`          | ` 1.0.0 .. 1.11` |
| `1.1`          | `>= 1.12`        |

### Usage

Include the following dependency in your project.

Gradle:

```groovy
implementation 'io.testerra:qc11-connector:1.0'
// From Testerra framework
implementation 'io.testerra:surefire-connector:1.0.0'
```

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.testerra</groupId>
  <artifactId>qc11-connector</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
<!-- From Testerra framework -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.testerra</groupId>
  <artifactId>surefire-connector</artifactId>
  <version>1.12</version>
</dependency>
```

## Documenation

### Synchronization

The easiest way to setup your project for automatic synchronization is by adding a `qcconnection.properties` file to
your `/src/test/resources/` directory.

````properties
qc.connection.server=
qc.connection.domain=
qc.connection.project=
qc.connection.user=
qc.connection.password=
qc.sync.active=true
qc.test.failed.upload.screenshots=true
qc.upload.videos=true
qc.test.failed.upload.videos=true
````

Basically the synchronization will work by two explicit annotations that can be set.

#### Annotated class mode

To enable synchronization you should add the annotation `QCTestset` to your class containing the test methods. The given value
should match the complete path of Quality Center or Application Lifecycle Management test set, for an example see code snipped
below:

```java
@QCTestset("\\Root\\My\\Full\\Path\\TestSet")
public class CorrectClassAnnotationTest extends TesterraTest {

    @Test
    public void testMethodPass() {
      Assert.assertTrue(true);
    }
```

This little snippet will search for a test set called `\\Root\\My\\Full\\Path\\TestSet`. If found, the method name will be extracted
and searched as test name in QC/ALM. If found, the result will be synchronized to this test case.

#### Annotated test method mode

While the class annotation is necessary, the method annotation is not. In case, you don't use the method names as test names you can
set the `QCTestname` at each test method. The hpqc-connector will then lookup the given value as test name instead of the method
name itself.

````java

@QCTestset("\\Root\\My\\Full\\Path\\TestSet")
public class CorrectClassAnnotationTest extends TesterraTest {

    @Test
    @QCTestname("Pass_Test_01")
    public void testMethodPass() {
        Assert.assertTrue(true);
    }
}
````

### Properties

## Unit test

### qc-restclient

* Add a ``qcconnection.properties`` to `qc-restclient/src/test/resources`
* Run ``gradle testRestClient``

### qc11-connector

The test includes two single test runs:

* The ``testundertest`` creates different scenarios for result synchronization. The result has failed tests.
* The ``suite`` verifies the result of synchronization by connecting to HP QC via REST API to check the `Run` items.   

* Add a ``qcconnection.properties`` to `qc11-connector/src/test/resources`
* You need a Selenium server for ``testundertest`` suite
* Run ``gradle testQCConn -Ptestundertest``
* Run ``gradle testQCConn -Psuite``

## Publication

This module is deployed and published to Maven Central. All JAR files are signed via Gradle signing plugin.

The following properties have to be set via command line or ``~/.gradle/gradle.properties``

| Property                      | Description                                         |
